# PINN-Based Cosmic Structure Formation

Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Modeling Cosmic Structure Formation via the Vlasov–Poisson Framework


## Overview

This repository implements a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** framework to study **cosmic structure formation** in a simplified collisionless gravitational setting. The project focuses on learning the evolution of matter in phase space under self-consistent gravity, a core problem in computational cosmology.

Instead of using particle-based N-body simulations, the system dynamics are modeled using a neural network whose training is guided by **physical constraints** derived from the governing equations of motion. This allows the model to learn physically consistent solutions without relying on large-scale simulation datasets.

The project is designed as a **research-oriented prototype**, emphasizing clarity, extensibility, and physical interpretability rather than production-scale performance.

## Project Goals

- Model collisionless gravitational dynamics using a neural network representation  
- Enforce physical consistency through physics-based loss functions  
- Explore PINNs as surrogate solvers for simplified cosmic structure formation  
- Build a clean and extensible research codebase suitable for further experimentation  
- Serve as a stepping stone toward higher-dimensional and more realistic cosmological models  


## Physical Problem Description

Cosmic structure formation arises from the gravitational amplification of small density fluctuations in an initially near-uniform matter distribution. For collisionless matter such as dark matter, the evolution is governed by phase-space dynamics coupled to a gravitational potential generated by the matter itself.

In this repository, the system is modeled in a reduced setting suitable for PINN-based experimentation. The neural network learns a continuous representation of the phase-space distribution while being constrained to respect gravitational self-consistency.

This setup captures the essential physics needed to study:
- Nonlinear gravitational evolution  
- Density clustering over time  
- Stability and consistency of learned physical solutions  


## Methodology

The core idea of the project is to **embed physical laws directly into the neural network training process**.

- A neural network is used to represent the phase-space distribution of matter.
- The training objective includes multiple physics-based loss terms that penalize violations of collisionless dynamics and gravitational consistency.
- Initial conditions are explicitly enforced to anchor the learned solution.
- All required derivatives are computed using automatic differentiation.

No labeled simulation data is required; the model learns solely by minimizing violations of the governing physical constraints.
